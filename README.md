<h1>What is TatoeBattle?</h1>
<p>TatoeBattle is a language learning game that aims to teach students the meaning and usage of words through the context of complete sentences.
Once in a game, the app provides random sentences in English and contestants are pitted against each other in trying to come up with the most
accurate translation for a specified language. This provides users a good opppurtunity to draw upon what they already know as well as see how
unknown words are used and in what contexts - all in a stimulating, gamified environment!</p>
<p>Sentences are sourced from <b>Tatoeba</b>, a free collaborative online database of example sentences geared towards foreign language learners. </p>
